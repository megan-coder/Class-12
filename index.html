                    Heartless, by Marissa Meyer, is the imagined back story of Lewis Carroll's character the Queen of
                    Hearts from his novel Alice in Wonderland. The story follows Catherine as a young woman who falls in
                    love with the King's new joker only to discover that he has been sent to Hearts for the purpose of
                    stealing her heart.</p>

                    Delta sets out to rescue her family but quickly learns that in the Wastes no one can be
                    trusted—perhaps not even her childhood friend, Asher, who has been missing for nearly a decade. If
                    Delta can trust Asher, she just might decode the map and trade evidence of the Verdant to the
                    General for her family. What Delta doesn’t count on is what waits at the Verdant: a long-forgotten
                    secret that will shake the foundation of her entire world.

One of my favorite lofi stations is chill radio.</p>
